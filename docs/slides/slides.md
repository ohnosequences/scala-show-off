# Scala?

----

## Infrastructure

- **JVM**-based (GC, optimizations, ...)
- **Java** interoperability
- (can be) as fast as **Java**, sometimes more!

## Design

- (kinda) contains Java
- functional features
- strict eval by default
- funny type system

### wait, how?

is complicated...

### Java compat

> Scala = Java - ";"

Not that is a good idea, but...

<!-- TODO use libs, syntax, same features -->

### Functional programming in Scala

- functions
- immutable values, (primitive) recursion support
- type abstraction
- type classes

### Type system

- Incredibly complex
- powerful, the compiler is crap though
- nice ideas, spoilt by Java compat requirements

<!-- TODO: funny type-level stuff goes here -->

#### Single most useful feature

**Type members!!**

and implicits! yeah that's two

### DSLs

### Ecosystem

- Spark
- Akka ??
- Twitter stuff (Finagle and the like)
